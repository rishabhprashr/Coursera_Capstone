        "USA is a large and ethnically diverse country. Its largest city New York has a long history of international immigration. Asians, Europeans,Africans,etc make up a large amount of this population and New York is at the centre of it. Cultural diversity brings along a difference of preferences ,opinions,background and tastes. Our goal here is ananlyzing the diversity and popularity of restaurants in the neighborhoods of New York to come up with a business strategy and the most suitable neighborhood to establish the business among all the given neighborhoods. We will use Foursquare places API to find out venues and explore the neighborhoods and scrape out details in a given radius. Our goal here is finding the popular cuisines of different neigborhoods to establish a fusion style restaurant catering to different tastes of multi ethnic population in a diverse neighborhood."
